    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This book provides the methods, techniques, and tools for data-driven research using spatial and biodiversity data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to promote open science by providing accessible, reproducible workflows, analysis tools, and training materials that anyone can use and adapt. Through this book, we aim to increase collaboration, improve methodological transparency, and empower researchers to explore and innovate with our shared data and resources. Whether youâ€™re looking for insights, examples or hands-on tutorials, this knowledge base provides a robust starting point for a wide range of research needs in biodiversity and ecological sustainability science.\n",
    "Our training materials, utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, will focus on key considerations when handling spatial data and explore possibilities for linking biodiversity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will provide valuable resources for scientists at various stages of their careers, enhancing their ability to manage and utilize spatial data effectively. By focusing on interdisciplinary applicability and practical training, our materials will fill a critical gap in current RDM education."
