    "The objective of this notebook is to provide training materials for spatial data. To enhance research data management (RDM), there is a pressing need for specialized training materials and datasets. These resources will offer practical guidance on RDM and serve as templates for researchers' own data. Our training materials, utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, will focus on key considerations when handling spatial data and explore possibilities for linking biodiversity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective RDM is crucial for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of research findings. However, many researchers lack comprehensive training in managing spatial data. This project addresses this gap by providing targeted training materials that offer practical, hands-on experience with these types of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will provide valuable resources for scientists at various stages of their careers, enhancing their ability to manage and utilize spatial data effectively. By focusing on interdisciplinary applicability and practical training, our materials will fill a critical gap in current RDM education."
