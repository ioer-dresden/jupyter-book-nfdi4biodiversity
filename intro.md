## Introduction

This book provides the methods, techniques, and tools for data-driven research using data from our [IOER RDC Dataverse](https://data.fdz.ioer.de/). This book is an automated knowledge base generated from several IOER staff notebooks. Our goal is to promote open science by providing accessible, reproducible workflows, analysis tools, and training materials that anyone can use and adapt. Through this book, we aim to increase collaboration, improve methodological transparency, and empower researchers to explore and innovate with our shared data and resources. Whether you're looking for insights, examples or hands-on tutorials, this knowledge base provides a robust starting point for a wide range of research needs in biodiversity and ecological sustainability science.
